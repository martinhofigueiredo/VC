# __Project 1 â€“ Estimation of the apparent motion.__ 
Visual motion perception from a moving observer is the most often encountered case in real life
situations. It is a complex and challenging problem, although, it can promote the arising of new
applications.

1) Implement two traditional optical flow techniques with multichannel and multiresolution
with refinement approaches, namely: (Local) Lucas-Kanade and (Global) Horn-Schunck.

2) Consider the following metrics to assess the quality of your implementation:
     - Average angular error (AAE) and standard deviation
     - Average end-point error (EPE) and standard deviation
     - Dataset for benchmarking: [link](https://vision.middlebury.edu/flow/data/)

3) Discuss the results, taking into consideration the following paper: 

> Andry et al. (2013), Revisiting Lucas-Kanade and Horn-Schunck, Journal of Computer Engineering and Informatics, Apr. 2013, Vol. 1 Iss. 2, PP. 23-29. 

Results must be provided as a table.

4) Consider the image sequences for this project and estimate the optical flow using these two
techniques. Produce two videos per image sequence showing the magnitude and orientation of
the flow using the color scheme presented in the lectures. Discuss the results obtained.
Image sequences for this project:
